Welcome to Crochet

Crochet is a light weight web framework oriented to rapid prototyping of
REST API. If you are looking for a Rails like framework written in Scala,
please take a look at Lift at http://liftweb.net/.

Crochet targets to help quickly prototype REST APIs relying on the flexibility
of the Scala language. The initial ideas for Crochet were inspired after
reading Gabriele Renzi post on creating a picoframework with Scala (see
http://www.riffraff.info/2009/4/11/step-a-scala-web-picoframework) and
the need for quickly prototyping APIs for pilot projects. Crochet also
provides mechanisms to hide repetitive tasks involved with default responses
and authentication/authorization piggybacking on the mechanics provided by
application servers.

The project uses SBT (http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/) to handle
dependencies and the build process.
